	help
	  This repositories contains some examples to work with and evaluate 9-bit UART solutions on Microchip SAMA5 processors.
	  Some processors support hardware 9-bit mode and features surrounding this mode, and some do not.
	  However, even in those cases it is still possible to make use of 9-bit mode.
	  In all cases, the Linux kernel API does not provide a standard way of using all of the necessary features.
